Habicus is a platform for people who have a desire to reach their goals. Habicus is a data-proven accountability system that utilizes concepts from the fields of behavioral economics and beahvioral psychology to help people realize their full potential. Unlike existing tools, Habicus offers peer-to-peer and self-accountability options and does so in an easier to manage fashion.


## Installation

Windows, OS X, Linux

## Usage example

Are you tired of writing down goals only to fail days or weeks later? Habitate is a P2P accountability tool that puts financials on the line to ensure you achieve your goals at the interval you desire. Need an extra boost? Habitate enables you to add an additional verifier to your account so they can mark off that your goal for that day was completed in time. Failing to do so, the accountability user will receive the funds you pledged to that goal.
